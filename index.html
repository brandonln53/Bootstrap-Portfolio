            <p>Brandon Nelson here. Welcome to my web development portfolio website. I earned a BA degree in English from Central College in Pella, IA. I've had a long career in outside sales and, most recently, operational leadership roles. With a passion for problem-solving and technology, I have dived into web development. I'm currently enrolled in the University of Denver Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp, with a completion date of June 8, 2020. 
            </p>
            <p>This website is designed to tell you a little about me and my accomplishments so far, as well as give you ways of reaching out to me. I'm interested in web development and technical writing opportunities. I bring research expertise, an understanding of working with GitHub, HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery application, interpersonal communication, and leadership skills to your projects. Always moving in a positive direction and being a great teammate are professional (and personal!) values of mine.</p>
            <p>In my downtime, I enjoy spending time with my wife and three kids; listening to mystery and self-development audio books; weight training, with fast walking mixed in; and making my yard look great. Patience, accuracy, and productivity are additional important values when working with teammates or on my own. Thanks for exploring my portfolio site!</p>
