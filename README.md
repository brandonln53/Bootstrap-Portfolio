# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Brandon Nelson's portfolio website utilizing bootstrap code. I prefer a minimal, clean, look. With that said, I opted out of heavy colors in the background on purpose. I'm happy with the results, but I will continue to fine-tune this portfolio site.

* Navbar, header, and contact form in the website comes to you courtesy of Bootstrap.
* Social Media button code was pulled from Font Awesome.
* Placeholder images come to you from Unsplash.

Thank you!
